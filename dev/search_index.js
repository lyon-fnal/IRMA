Because Hist uses dynamic arrays, it is not a Julia isbitstype. This means that you must serialize/deserialize histograms if you want to pass them between MPI ranks. A SHist or Static Histogram uses a SVector from StaticArrays.jl, making an isbitstype. Therefore, you do not need to use serialization with MPI.","category":"page"},{"location":"shist/#Construction-and-conversion","page":"Static Histograms","title":"Construction and conversion","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"shist/","page":"Static Histograms","title":"Static Histograms","text":"You can create an SHist from a Hist with the constructor.","category":"page"},{"location":"shist/","page":"Static Histograms","title":"Static Histograms","text":"using IRMA\nusing OnlineStats\nh = fit!(Hist(-5:0.2:5), randn(1_000))\nsh = SHist(h)","category":"page"},{"location":"shist/","page":"Static Histograms","title":"Static Histograms","text":"Note that an SHist is immutable.
